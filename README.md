## Hey there! :wave:
I am Duygu and I am an introverted extrovert. I can be quite outspoken when there is a situation that calls for it but I am usually not that loud. 

- I ***love*** playing video games. Especially **Fallout 76**. The image above is a screenshot of me and my friend finding our way through the post-apocalyptic wasteland. 

- I also really love cooking. I am sure you will taste something I made at some point in the next few months!

- I can find my orientation very easily. It's like I have a compass running constantly on the background. So, I am a good choice for a hiking buddy. :smirk:

#### Things that I love the most in the universe:

1. My fiance :ring:

2. Star Wars

2. Fallout :video_game:

3. A sunny day on the beach with nothing to do but to rest. :sunny: :tropical_fish:

#### What do i want to achieve by completing this training?

I really would like to have a job where I look forward to my work day. So far, it hasn't been the case. So I decided to forego the comfort of doing a job I already know well and earn well to switch my career. I am 31 years old. I feel like *now is the time!*

#### My fears:

1. Fish :fish:
2. Spiders :spider:
3. Driving in Turkey :car: :joy:

#### Things I look forward to:

- Going on a long holiday
- Getting a job I like
- Buying and renovating a house with my partner

#### Things I value the most working in a team:

1. Respecting work distribution and doing one's own part.
2. Helping each other to win as a team.
3. Being on time for meetings.
